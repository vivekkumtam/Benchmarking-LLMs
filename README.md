# LLM-Based Document Understanding

This project focuses on evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and processing documents. The primary goal is to assess how well current LLMs can comprehend, analyze, and perform tasks such as summarization, information extraction, and question answering based on the content of the documents.

## Project Overview

This project leverages popular pre-trained LLMs (e.g., GPT, BERT, etc.) to process various document types and measure the models' understanding. The evaluation is carried out using several accuracy metrics, including **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, **ROUGE**, and more.

### Key Features

- **Document Summarization**: Automatically generate summaries of documents.
- **Information Extraction**: Extract key data and entities from unstructured text.
- **Question Answering**: Answer questions based on the document content.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the models using precision, recall, F1-score, ROUGE, BLEU, and other relevant metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics are used to assess the accuracy and understanding of the LLMs:

- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**: These metrics are used to measure the accuracy of classification or extraction tasks.
- **ROUGE Score**: Used for evaluating the quality of document summarization. ROUGE-L is particularly useful for comparing longest common subsequences between the reference and model-generated summaries.
- **BLEU Score**: Primarily used for evaluating translation tasks but can be adapted to measure the quality of text generation.
- **Exact Match (EM)**: For question-answering tasks, EM checks whether the predicted answer matches the ground truth exactly.
- **Logical Consistency**: Evaluates whether the model's reasoning and output align with the document's factual and logical content.
- **Content Overlap**: Measures token or semantic similarity between the modelâ€™s output and the reference text.
